INSTALL

1. Install as any other Zikula module (copy Zphpbb directory to modules directory, go to Admin panel, Extensions and install).
2. Delete directory Zphpbb/vendor/phpbb/install. Keep in mind, that if need to convert/import/export data, you have to copy this directory again in this place.
3. If you like, prepare site logo in a file named site_logo.gif, and copy in proper style directory:
    Zphpbb/vendor/phpbb/styles/subsilver2/imageset/site_logo.gif
    Zphpbb/vendor/phpbb/styles/subsilver2/imageset/site_logo.gif
This affects maximized forum view only. Module install script will try to copy your site logo, if it is in Zikula_root_dir/images/logo.gif.
4. Main forum page is displayed placing {Zphpbb} in the menu block, or as normally with user main module function. Check how installed forum looks like.
5. Go to module admin panel and make appropriate settings. Here you will find various possibilities to import data.
6. Try out special module theme prosilver_z, which is based on default phpBB prosilver theme.
6. If you like this module to be supported better, please donate in project page.

Have fun!

UPGRADE FROM ZphpBB2

Upgrade is possible as any other upgrade in Zikula extensions.
Upgrade from PNphpBB2 is not supported. first upgrade to ZphpBB2 to be performed.

DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL phpBB

1. Avatars. Directory for avatars is not in "...forum directory.../images/avatar", but in 
    "...Zikula root directory.../images/avatar"
    Please manually move respective images/folders.
    The presumption is to make installation directory clean from any uploads/runtime changes
2 Please check avatars and file (attachments) directories - they have to be created at respective places.
    Move there files if any.
